## 2026-08-22: exact foundation

- Initialized the repository and pinned Python 3.13 plus SymPy, NumPy, SciPy,
  mpmath, pytest, and Ruff.
- Derived accelerations directly from Newton's equations.
- Symbolically verified normalized $I_0$, $U_0$, and the corrected $D''(0)$.
- Encoded the Euclid map and leg-swap involution with exact rational arithmetic.
- Tested a Hopf residual example that defeats mutual-distance derivatives at
  syzygy.
- Encoded and tested the universal zero-angular-momentum reduced kinetic and
  potential expressions.

Evidence level: EXACT SYMBOLIC IDENTITY for algebraic checks; no global
dynamical conclusion.

## 2026-08-22: defect-barrier falsification

Three DOP853 runs at $u=1/3$, ending at $t=4$, used respectively

- $(rtol,atol,max\_step)=(10^{-11},10^{-13},0.005)$;
- $(10^{-13},10^{-15},0.001)$;
- $(2.22\times10^{-14},2\times10^{-16},0.0005)$.

All gave $D(0.376)=-0.004664128339$ to the shown digits.  The prior minimum
separation was $0.002791245371$; the first two prior relative energy drifts
were $5.3\times10^{-10}$ and $2.9\times10^{-12}$.  Thus the proposed global
$D>0$ cone fails after a close but numerically positive encounter.

Evidence level: ORDINARY NUMERICAL EVIDENCE.  Reproduce the middle run with:

```bash
.venv/bin/python -m scripts.probe_dynamics --u 1/3 --t-end 4 \
  --samples 20001 --rtol 1e-13 --atol 1e-15 --max-step 0.001
```
